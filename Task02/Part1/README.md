# Real Time Graphics Task 1 
## Setup 
To build and run, open the project in 64-bit MSVC command shell on windows.
Then simply run:  
``` .\build.cmd ```

The built files are written to the \out directory - there you can find the task02.exe which is the compiled executable.

## VSCode
If you open the project in a VSCode window via the developer console, you can also build the project with ctrl+shift+b and launch it with ctrl+F5 (for no debugging)
Additionally F5 launches the project with debugging enabled.
